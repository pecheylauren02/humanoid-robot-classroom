# Humanoid Robot System - Classroom Environment

This repository contains an object-oriented software system designed to support the operation of a humanoid robot in a classroom environment. It includes the PDF report detailing the system design, UML diagrams, and rationale for chosen operations. 

This work has been completed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming module** for the **Master of Computer Science program at the University of Essex**. Future updates may include Python implementations of the software for simulation and task management.
